# Face Detection and Photo Capture

This Python script allows you to capture photos using your computer's default camera and detect faces in the captured frames. The script uses the OpenCV library for face detection and the Pillow library for saving the captured photos.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Pillow (`PIL`)

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```
pip install opencv-python pillow
```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

```
python face_detection_photo_capture.py
```

2. The script will ask you to enter the number of photos you want to capture. Enter the desired number and press Enter.

3. The camera feed will be displayed in a window titled "Faces Detected". The script will continuously detect faces in the camera feed and draw rectangles around them.

4. When you're ready to capture a photo, press the Enter key.

5. The script will prompt you to enter a picture name (without an extension). Enter the desired name and press Enter.

6. If the entered picture name already exists, the script will append a counter to the name to make it unique (e.g., `picture_1.png`, `picture_2.png`, etc.).

7. The captured photo with detected faces will be saved with the provided name.

8. Repeat steps 4-6 to capture additional photos until you have reached the desired number of photos.

9. Once the desired number of photos has been captured, the script will automatically exit, and the camera window will close.

## Notes

- The script assumes that you have a working camera connected to your computer.
- The face detection algorithm used is the Haar Cascade classifier provided by OpenCV. This algorithm may not be as accurate as more modern deep learning-based face detection models.
- The captured photos are saved in the same directory as the script.
- If no extension is provided for the picture name, the script will use `.png` as the default extension.
